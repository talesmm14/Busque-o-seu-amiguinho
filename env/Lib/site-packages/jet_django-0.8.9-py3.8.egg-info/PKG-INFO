        ===========
        
        * Jet Admin: https://about.jetadmin.io

        **Jet** is a SaaS service that automatically generates back office for your Django Application through REST API of **Jet Bridge** package installed to your project.
        
        – **Visual**. Admin interface can be easily changed without need of development with the help of Visual Editor. 
        
        – **Secure**. Jet does not access your data: its transferred directly from browser to your application.
        
        – **Customizable**. Flex functions allow you to solve your specific business tasks when standard functionality is not enough.
        
        This is a complete remake of popular `Django Jet <https://github.com/geex-arts/django-jet>`_ admin interface.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - **CRUD (create, read, update, delete):**
          
          Create, view, update and delete data. Display it in an easy format, and then search and filter your data.
        
        - **Dashboard:** 
        
          Create reports and visualize KPIs. Monitor new data like new orders, comments, etc.
          
        - **Works with any technology:** 
        
          The interface is generated automatically based on an analysis of the data and data structure of your applications.
        
        - **Visual editor:** 
          
          Customize the admin area to make it easy for any manager to use. Allow managers to modify the interface, configure features, and set up analytics widgets without using any developers — just like WIX, Squarespace….
        
        - **Secure:** 
        
          Your data is safe. We do not have access to your information. We simply plug your information in to an easy-to-use interface for you to interact with it better.
        
        - **Works on any device:** 
        
          The interface is optimized for any device from phones to tablets to desktops.
        
        - **Quick installation:** 
        
          It takes only a few hours to integrate with your project.
        
        - **Available 24/7:** 
        
          Use it around the clock and don’t worry about updates — we take care of that.
        
        - **Manage users:** 
        
          Assign access rights to any data from within the panel.
        
        - **Activity log:**
